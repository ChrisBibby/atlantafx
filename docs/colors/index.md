AtlantaFX as well as uses standard JavaFX themes [looked-up colors]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link colors/looked-up-colors.md %}), but unlike them, in AtlantaFX all color variables start with `-color-` prefix.

There're [global variables]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link colors/global-variables.md %}), that are defined at the Scene root level and individual control variables. The latter defined for each individual control. Check corresponding control reference for the info.
